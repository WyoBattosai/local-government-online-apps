# local-government-online-apps

This subset of our open source software helps local governments provide web applications to their citizens via Esri's ArcGIS.com ecosystem, a place where individuals and organizations can create maps and applications to share on the Internet.

## Features

* Runs in the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers ([supported browsers][]) on browser screens from phone through tablet to desktop. (Find, Edit, and Filter is currently for desktop only.)

    1. basic configuration: titles and icons by configuring the web application using the standard ArcGIS online configuration program
    2. advanced configuration: adjustment of application styles and content
    3. unlimited modifications to the open source

Currently, two application configurations are provided:
